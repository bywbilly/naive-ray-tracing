# naive-ray-tracing
A naive ray tracing for VR final project

I have implementd soft-shadow, transparency, half-transparency and color-bleeding.

I have also implementd the ground shading, which makes the objects more vivid than flat shading.

Here is some pictures for display.

## Softshadow

Also, softshadow is really expensice to render.
